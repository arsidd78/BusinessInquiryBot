<h3>This bot will go to the site :</h3> <a href=https://ner.economy.ae/Search_By_BN.aspx>https://ner.economy.ae/Search_By_BN.aspx</a>
<h3>At starting this bot will ask about the business name, this business name is relevant because the data that will be stored in a csv file will have this name plus the logs will also be named after this input</h3>
<p> After the site is loaded you will see an arabic version you can click on english and retype the business name in input field of the site than you can solve human authentication
afterwards you can click on inquiry page. You have to do this step during the first two minutes of the program this is max limit.</p>
<h3> Scrapping: </h3>
  <p>After this the inquiry page will be loaded and than the scrapping will start because of the infrastructure of the site it will take 20 to 40 minutes to scrap page 1 than it will moved to second page
  the pagination is in loop. This loop requires a healthy network connection plus the site itself could freeze the requests in this manner the program will be failed. As a solution I have designed a program in
    a way that when you restart the bot you can manually go the last page it was scrapping and the scrapping will start right from there. There could be some duplicated data that could be scrapped but you can than format
    your csv file any way you like.
  </p>
  <h3>Considerations:</h3>
  <p>You must be really patient while using this bot you can do different chores and let the bot do its job. Just donot do anything that requires  a big chunk of your memory thats it !</p>
  <p> Changing site to english is must</p>
  <p>This bot is designed and tested for english site and content only, the address can be in arabic but not the rest.</p>
  <p>At start the bot will ask an input of business name fill it than notice once the site is loaded the input field for business name should be filled before switching the language, than must click on english link
  after that retype business name solve captcha and hit inquiry btn or enter key. All of this will done in two minutes. Two minutes is enough for all of this.
  </p>
  <p>Enjoy the bot !</p>
